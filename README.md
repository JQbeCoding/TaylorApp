# TaylorApp

Brought to you by **Soxiety Technology Solutions Research**, Ja'Quis Franklin, and Taylor Douglas. The Taylor app is a mental wellness app that lets users create task, schedules, and mood checks that feed a pet of the player's choosing within the game. This game will be open-source for community input and even improvements of the game along with full transparency of the research players will participate in.

## **Transparency Statement**

Personal data (like name, email, location, device ID, etc.) will not be collected nor needed to use the app. To clear up any confusion on what that may mean, the only thing needed to create a profile in the game is a uniquen non-personal tag and password. Soxiety will **NOT** use personal data in the game from specific players for things like targeted advertisement, personal data collection, or selling data. The data collected will be anonymized and aggregated results of habits such as screen time, common tasks, percentage of completion, and other general statistics for the sake of research. Soxiety must ask consent in order for you to participate in this and the way to opt-out will be a pop up when creating account and in the profile menus. We strive for consistent privacy standards across both the web and mobile versions. Should there be any necessary differences in data handling, we commit to providing clear, explicit updates to all players.
